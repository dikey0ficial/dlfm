I'll write this in dialog form, because this ~~looks intriguing and unordinary~~ is much simpler to write text when you imaging you are explaining to someone.

## Why GUI?

because dlfm is also in demand by generic people, who don't want to learn TOML syntax, to write configs by themselves and to keep console window openned.

# Why `dlfm GUI`, but not just `dlfm`?

firstly, because legacy. secondly, because yes.

# And also why small case?

it looks better, IMO

## OK, how should dlfm GUI look?

In main menu, there is the only button: `Start` (or `Stop`). Under there's info about track, representation of discord status, logs output under spoiler and settings button.

In settings menu, there's just typical settings list with submenus and other. Also there will be ability to set up config path.

Application should have dark (default, as in discord) and light themes aviable.

Also it should support at least two languages â€” Russian and English. Localizations realisation should be easy-to-expand.

Also app must be able to hide to tray.
